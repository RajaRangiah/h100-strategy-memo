# H100 Strategy Memo

This repository contains an executive-level infrastructure strategy memo
on optimizing H100 GPU fleet economics and governance.

This memo demonstrates how large GPU fleets leak 15–25% of annual value due to scheduling misalignment — and how governance recovers $20–40M/year at 10k-GPU scale.
